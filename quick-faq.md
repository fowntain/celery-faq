That's a false alarm. Make sure you fully disable your antivirus so Celery can properly access Roblox! Celery is trusted by tens of thousands of people. Yes, it's safe.
<br /><br />

> How can I avoid being banned?  

You may avoid being banned by Roblox by:  
• Use an alt account  
• Do not use the account switcher  
• Use a VPN (to prevent an IP ban)
<br /><br />

> Oh no, I've been banned! What now?  

If you've been banned by Roblox, we can't do anything to fix it. Try making another account. If you exploited on your main account, that's your fault.
